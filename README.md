# Vanilla
So I decided I'd try setting up my vanilla build to support Grunt. We'll see how this goes...

### Fresh Computer?
Node is a prerequisite for Grunt. If you donâ€™t have Node installed be sure to install [Node.js](nodejs.org)

Next, you'll want to install Grunt's command line interface (CLI) globally. You may need to use sudo (for OSX, *nix, BSD etc) or run your command shell as Administrator (for Windows) to do this.
`npm install -g grunt-cli`

### Getting Started
1. Change `cd ...` to this project's root directory
2. Run `npm install` to install Grunt, Grunt plugins, etc.
3. Run `grunt`

### Build Something Already (BSA)
- Edit **source**
- View locally at `localhost:8000`
- Deploy **build**
